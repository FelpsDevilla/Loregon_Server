## :technologist: Development

### Standard Development

After cloning the repository, follow the steps below:

1. `npm install`
2. Create a `.env` file based on [.env.example](.env.example)
3. Run `npm run createDB` to create the database tables
4. Run `npm run dev` to start the application

> [!NOTE]  
> These commands only start the application server.  
> To configure the database locally, create the database beforehand with the name `LoregonDB`.

### üê≥ Testing the Application with Docker

As an alternative to a local Node.js environment, you can test the application using **Docker** and **Docker Compose**, which ensures a standardized environment with the database automatically configured.

#### Steps:

1. Make sure Docker and Docker Compose are installed.
2. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   npm run docker
   ```

This will:

- Build the Docker image of the backend
- Start a PostgreSQL database container
- Run the migration to create tables and an admin user
- Run the application in development mode (port 8000 by default)
